# Clinic Management System

This is a simple command-line based Clinic Management System implemented in Java.

## Features

- **CRUD Operations**: Users can perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on patients and nurses.
- **Interactive UI**: The application features a command-line interface for user interaction.
- **Data Types**: It handles integers, doubles, and strings for various data.
- **Data Structures**: Uses collections such as `Map` for storing patient and nurse data.
- **Control Flow**: Features loops and conditional statements for managing the flow of execution.
- **Method Calls**: Implements several methods that perform different operations.
- **Inheritance**: Utilizes inheritance, for example, a `Person` class may be inherited by `Nurse` and `Patient`.
- **Method Overriding**: Demonstrates method overriding.
- **Interfaces/Abstract Classes**: Implements abstract class `Person` and overrides its methods in subclasses.
